# Kindle Highlights

## MAIN OBJECTIVE
Showing desired number of random Kindle highlights daily based on the selected categories.

## BASIC USE CASE
The user can import Kindle highlights based on `My Clippings.txt` file. These highlights will be stored in the phone's memory. The user can add different categories and assign them to highlights. One highlight can be assigned to multiple categories. So the highlights can be grouped by categories and books they belong to. The user then selects the desired number of highlights he wants to see every day and categories/books they should be assigned to. Every day the application will show different randomly selected highlights based on user's settings.
